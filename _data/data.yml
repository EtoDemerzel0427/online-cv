    title: About Me
    summary: |
        I am Weiran Huang. Currently, I am a fourth-year computer science undergrad at Beijing University 
        of Posts and Telecommunications. Previously, I was an R\&D intern at MOMO Inc., a research Assistant
        at Chinese Academy of Sciences and Penn State University respectively. In Feb. 2020, I will start a new
        internship at Microsoft Research Aisa.

        In my opinion, computer science is a field where scientific research and engineering are closely combined. 
        As one who has experience in both academia and industry, my career ambition is to bridge the gap between
        advanced theories and real-world applications to make human's life better. 

        To achieve this goal, my current plan is to pursue a master's degree in CS or ECE in North America.

      company: MOMO Inc.
      details: |
          
          - Developed a real-time face tracking tool which introduced dynamic rigidity prior to 3D face reconstruction, increased the stability
          score by 25.7% under drastic poses and expressions.
          - Translated an existing MATLAB project into C++ using OpenCV, and modularized the code for easier maintenance and higher efficiency.
          -  Replaced the projection method in our face-changing app, “ZAO” with perspective projection, increased the reconstruction accuracy
          by 11.4%.

    - role: Summer Research Intern
      time: 2019.6 - 2019.8
      company: Penn State University
      details: |
          
          - Extensively studied several academic papers published in top conferences on graph adversarial learning.
          - Implemented several graph adversarial attack algorithms in Python, achieved comparable results as reported in papers but lower 
          overhead.
      
    - role: Research Assistant
      time: 2018.5 - 2019.5
      company: Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences
      details: |
          
          - Actively participated in several research projects on recommender systems and graph mining.
          - Proposed a novel Graph Convolutional Network variant GraphAIR with cooperators, which is the first to explicitly take into account 
          the non-linear neighborhood interactions. The paper of GraphAIR has been submitted to TKDE, preprint available here on arxiv.
          - Implemented GraphAIR in Tensorflow, and it outperformed all baselines by significant margins on node classification and link
          prediction tasks, ranking first, second and fourth on 3 benchmark datasets respectively on paperswithcode.com.
