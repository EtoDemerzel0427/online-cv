career-profile:
    title: About Me
    summary: |
        I am Weiran Huang. Currently, I am a fourth-year computer science undergrad at Beijing University 
        of Posts and Telecommunications. Previously, I was an R&D intern at <em>MOMO Inc.</em>, a research Assistant
        at <em>Chinese Academy of Sciences</em> and <em>Penn State University</em> respectively. In Feb. 2020, I will start a new
        internship at <em>Microsoft Research Asia</em>.

        In my opinion, computer science is a field where scientific research and engineering are closely combined. 
        As one who has experience in both academia and industry, my career ambition is to bridge the gap between
        advanced theories and real-world applications to make humans' life better. 

        To achieve this goal, my current plan is to pursue a master's degree in CS or ECE in North America starting from Fall 2020. 
      

education:
    - degree: B.ENG. in Computer Science
      university: Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications
      time: 2016 - 2020

          - GPA: 88.23/100
          - Rank: 25/315
  
       

experiences:
    - role: (Incoming) R&D Intern
      time: 2019.2 - Present 
      company: Microsoft Research Asia
      details: |
        
          I will join the ARD Incubation Group at MSRA working on Spatial-Temporal Prediction problems for traffic scheduling and resource
          optimization from Feb. 11th 2020.

    - role: R&D Intern
      time: 2019.9 - 2020.1
      company: MOMO Inc.
      details: |
          I worked in the 3D Reconstruction Group, Deep Learning Lab at MOMO Inc., under Dr. Tianxiang Zheng's mentorship.
          - Developed a real-time face tracking tool which introduced dynamic rigidity prior to 3D face reconstruction, increased the stability
          score by <strong>25.7%</strong> under drastic poses and expressions.
          - Translated an existing MATLAB project into C++ using OpenCV, and modularized the code for easier maintenance and higher efficiency.
          -  Replaced the projection method in our face-changing app, <em>“ZAO”</em> with perspective projection, increased the reconstruction accuracy
          by <strong>11.4%</strong>.

    - role: Summer Research Intern
      time: 2019.6 - 2019.8
      company: Penn State University
      details: |
          I researched on graph adversarial learning, speficically, robust graph neural network models, under the supervision of Prof. 
          Suhang Wang at Penn State University. 
          - Extensively studied several academic papers published in top conferences on graph adversarial learning.
          - Implemented several graph adversarial attack algorithms in Python, achieved comparable results as reported in papers but lower 
          overhead.
      
    - role: Research Assistant
      time: 2018.5 - 2019.5
      company: Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences
      details: |
          I researched on network embedding and graph neural networks under the supervision of Dr. Shu Wu at CASIA. I was also a member of
          <em>Scientific Innovation Training Program</em>.
          - Actively participated in several research projects on recommender systems and graph mining.
          - Proposed a novel Graph Convolutional Network variant <em>GraphAIR</em> with cooperators, which is the first to explicitly take into account 
          the non-linear neighborhood interactions. The paper of <em>GraphAIR</em> has been submitted to TKDE, preprint available <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01731">
          here</a> on arxiv.
          - Implemented <em>GraphAIR</em> in Tensorflow, and it outperformed all baselines by significant margins on node classification and link
          prediction tasks, ranking <strong>first, second and fourth</strong> on 3 benchmark datasets respectively on <a href="https://paperswithcode.com/">
          paperswithcode.com</a>.
